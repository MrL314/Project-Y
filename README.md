## Setup

1. To begin, **[download this toolchain](https://github.com/MrL314/Project-Y/archive/refs/heads/linux.zip)** and obtain the folder called `other\SFC\ソースデータ\ヨッシーアイランド\日本_Ver0` from the July 2020 gigaleak.
	* You obtain these files at your own risk.
2. Copy the CONTENTS of the `日本_Ver0` folder (not the folder itself) into the folder named `VER_0` included with this tool.
3. Install `python3` through your package manager
3. Run `python3 setup.py` in a terminal, and ensure there are no errors.
